# React Essentials 1

This is a simple React website created to implement and showcase the concepts Iâ€™ve learned in React, including components, JSX, props, and state. The website contains brief descriptions and examples of each of these concepts to help users understand how they work in React applications.

The website is structured with sections that describe each concept and demonstrate how it can be used in a React app.

## Features

- **Components:** The website contains separate sections, each focusing on a different concept, with interactive examples.
- **JSX:** Demonstrates JSX syntax, showing how HTML-like code can be written inside JavaScript.
- **Props:** Shows how props are passed between components, with examples illustrating the concept.
- **State:** Illustrates how state is managed within components and how it can be updated in response to user actions.
